## Description

These 2 projects were completed for the Operating Systems course of the [Department of Computer Science of the Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/cs), during the Spring semester of 2019-2020.

The goal of these projects was to use parallelization with the help of C and threads that are provided by the POSIX library. More details on each project below:

- [1st Project](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Operating-Systems-2019-2020-/tree/main/1st%20Assignment)
- [2nd Project](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Operating-Systems-2019-2020-/tree/main/2nd%20Assignment)

## Environment

The POSIX library maintains compatibility for UNIX like systems, so a Unix-Linux distribution is needed in order for these programs to work. If your native OS isn't a Linux distribution, you can try running one in Virtual Box or VMware, so these projects can then be tested. GCC compiler is also required for the compilation of the programs. Most Linux distros have it installed by default.

- [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/) or any other Linux distribution
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)/[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)
- [GCC](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
- [POSIX](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15492-f07/www/pthreads.html) library
